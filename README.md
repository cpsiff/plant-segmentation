## Scripts
### segment.py
Performs segmentation on an image according to the specified segmentation method. Multiple segmentation methods are defined within the script, and more can be added easily. Written for use on CVPPP2017 dataset, could be adapted to others by changing the way files are read.

### evaluate_segmentation.py
Tests the accuracy of segmentation using Jaccard scores and f1 scores. Written for use on CVPPP2017 dataset, could be adapted to others by changing the way files are read.
